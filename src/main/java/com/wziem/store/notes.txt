Bean scopes: @Scope("type")
- Singleton - only one instance
- Prototype - new instance created every time I use it
- Request - lives for the duration of one HTTP request, good for storing request data
- Sesssion - new bean instance for each HTTP session

- this is a good moment to initialize everything you need after the creation of a bean - eg. open database/network connection
